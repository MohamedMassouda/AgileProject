# Welcome to Frontend branch
### This branch will contain all of your combined code
### Please make sure to follow the instructions in the README.md file

## Naming Convention
### It should be as follows:
- Follow the CamelCase naming convention for the component name
- components/ComponentName if the component doesn't need a css file
- components/ComponentName/ComponentName if the component needs a css file

**Note:**
- Your javascript files should be named as ComponentName.jsx (for the already created components I will rename them)
- Your css files should be named as ComponentName.css (for the already created components I will rename them) and the component itself should use it not in another component
- You can use any template you want as long as you understand the code
- You can follow any tutorial

## Necessities
- Formatter to be use: Prettier (You can install it as an extension in your code editor or by installing it using npm)

## Instructions
